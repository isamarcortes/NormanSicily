This folder contains three KMLs converted into GeoJSON files of the three historical provinces of Norman Sicily. The KMLs were built by georeferencing an image of the three provinces onto a map of modern Sicily using Google Earth Pro. The KML files were converted in QGIS to GeoJSON to make them simpler to access.
