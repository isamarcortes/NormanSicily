# Dedications
	We separated the data based on different attributes. For example, we created heat maps which show which areas have higher seismic classification values and we calculated which areas had more dedications than others. With the code, we were able to create choropleth maps on the province level. Using GIS, we were able to separate the data at the municipal (comune) level. The problem with separating the maps at the municipal level is that it becomes messy since. Although it is more accurate to separate attributes at the municipal level, it is not as visually intelligible as separating them at the province level.

	The first map indicates where the known monasteries in Norman Sicily were located.

	Dedications were grouped according to the following classifications:
		•	Group 1: Christ
		•	Group 2: All Saints
		•	Group 3: Theological Concepts (Holy Cross, Holy Spirit, Holy Trinity, etc.)
		•	Group 4: The Virgin Mary

	After plotting all four groups on the map, we needed to separate to see if there was any geographical clustering.

	After separating the 4 groups into different points, 3 colors were predominant. Each color was associated with a different type of dedication.
		•	Orange = The Virgin Mary
		•	Green = Theological Concepts (Holy Cross, Holy Spirit, Holy Trinity, etc.)
		•	Purple = All Saints
		•	White = Christ
The purple does not show due to the fact that there was only one monastery that was dedicated to all saints, located in Palermo, and it was surrounded by other monasteries.

	An easier way to see how the 4 groups clustered across Sicily is via a chloropleth map.

	The light olive green indicates that the highest concentration of monasteries were dedicated to the Virgin Mary. As you can see, that is most of Sicily. The red represents null values and the blue and dark green represent areas where monasteries were dedicated not to specific saints but instead to the theological concepts defined above.

	Next we can see the distribution of the 4 groups at the municipal level. Blue represents null values (in other words, no data present). It is better to represent the distribution of the 4 groups by using a chloropleth map at the province level rather than at the municipal level.
