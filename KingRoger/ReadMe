Depending on the time period, monastic foundations can be significantly shaped by particular rulers. Part of the GIS analysis of this project looked at separating the dataset into three categories: before Roger II's reign (pre-1112), during Roger II's reign (1112-1154) and after Roger II's reign (1154-1194). The reason why Roger II's reign was chosen as a delimiter is because it was both consequential and long, making up almost a full third of Sicily's Norman period.
