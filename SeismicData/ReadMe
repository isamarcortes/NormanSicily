The dataset is used in QGIS in order to create visualizations which can highlight different attributes in the dataset. First, the basemap is downloaded for commune and province from the Italian government website (http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata). These are the basemaps we will work with in order to visualize the data. Now the separation of the datasets is created by extracting what we visually want to see on the map. For example, if we want to separate the monasteries based on seismic class, we can visualize which monasteries are in seismic zone 3. We do this separation, not only for the seismic attribute, but for other attributes as well.
The seismic data was used from the CSV file to appropriately label each monastery based on their seismic set. This data is also used in the sustainability index to give an insight into the sustainability
