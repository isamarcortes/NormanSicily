The dataset was used in QGIS in order to create visualizations which can highlight different attributes. First, a basemap was downloaded for municipalities (comuni) and provinces from the Italian government's website. These are the basemaps we worked with in order to visualize the data. The separation of the datasets was then created by extracting what we wanted to visualize on the map. For example, if we wanted to separate the monasteries based on seismic class, we visualized which monasteries are in a specific seismic zone. We made this separation not only for the seismic attributes, but for other attributes as well.
