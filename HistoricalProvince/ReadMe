Sicily was divided into three historical provinces (valli) during its period of Muslim rule. These provinces - known as the Val di Noto (south), the Val Demone (east) and the Val di Mazara (west) - had strong religious characters. The Val di Mazara was populated predominantly by Muslims while the people of the Val Demone were predominantly Christian. The Val di Noto included both Muslims and Christians.
