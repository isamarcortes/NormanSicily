Founders' data are separated based on which founder(s) is associated with a given monastery.

I separated the CSV data to show the different founders of each monastery. You can click on each GeoJSON, which will show you the different founders.

As you can visualize, there are multiple files for different founders as they constitute an extensive list. Each GeoJSON contains monasteries based on specific founders. When clicking on a GeoJSON, the monasteries associated with specific founders will pop up. Some founders are area-specific.

Note that King Roger II appears often. Showing the founders of monasteries can give an indication of the influence and power of certain people who lived during this time. What is interesting about this founder list is that it includes a mix of men and women. Keep in mind that in Norman Sicily, women did not hold the same amount of power as men. Exploring the women who were founders would be an interesting path to pursue.
